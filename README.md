# Rank-balanced_binary_trees

Please see the README in the 'docs' directory for how to use the program and see the CODE_COMMENTS file for balancing cases which apply (these have not been rigorously checked). The trees have not been rigorously tested, testing is a TODO item.

Herein are implementations of trees described by the rank-balanced framework (Haeupler, B., Sen, S., and Tarjan, R. E. (2015). Rank-Balanced Trees. ACM Transactions on Algorithms, 11(4):1â€“26), specifically, AVL, WAVL, 2-3 and 2-3-4 trees. The core binary tree functions/algorithm call a particulary balancing algorithm that is user-defined at run-time. The output/performance of the different balancing algorithms can the be directly compared for the same set of input data.
