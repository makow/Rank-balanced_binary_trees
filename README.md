# Rank-balanced_binary_trees

Please see the README in the 'docs' directory for how to use the program and see the CODE_COMMENTS file for balancing cases which apply (these have not been rigorously checked). The trees have not been rigorously tested and is a TODO item.

These are implementations of trees described by the rank-balanced framework (Haeupler, B., Sen, S., and Tarjan, R. E. (2015). Rank-Balanced Trees. ACM Transactions on Algorithms, 11(4):1â€“26).
